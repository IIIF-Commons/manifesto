   "description":"The canvas needs to represent a 3d space into which the object is annotated, but it probably won't have whd (a cuboid); notion of xyz origin; annotations may be external (e.g., light source). Does it still define a cuboid coordinate space to make the boundary of permitted annotation? How then is the object scaled into the annotation space?",
